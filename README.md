### Download and install the APK manually

Apart from Google Play, you can download the app APKs from the [releases section](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-wallet-android/releases) to sideload.
There are APKs available for Testnet and Mainnet, and as a debug build and release build.

**Debug builds** are built on GitHub.
It is normal that Google Play Protect warns about
an unsafe app. GitHub builds the binaries with a certificate unknown to Google.
Because the certificate changes, you can't upgrade the app later - you need to uninstall and install fresh.

**Release builds** are built by me with my developer certificate and minified. This should reduce
Google Play Protect warnings, you'll be able to upgrade without losing your data and the app is
much smaller and faster, however, you have to trust me.

The APK file can be installed on your Android device. If you sideload for the first time,
[you can follow this guide](https://www.xda-developers.com/sideload-apps-how-to/).
